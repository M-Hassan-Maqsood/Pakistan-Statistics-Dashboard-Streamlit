# Pakistan-Statistics-Dashboard-Streamlit
I have developed a Pakistan Statistics dashboard. I have taken data from the past 55 years. The dashboard covers various parameters like all types of government expenditures across all sectors, imports or exports, the population (including male or female and urban area or rural area), birth rate, total loans, Tax and remittance, unemployment, GDP growth, and inflation rate, agriculture, and industry growth( all 
presented as % of GDP ).

I have provided a running slider to allow you to navigate between years from 1973 to 2022 and observe corresponding statistics. Another 
feature I have added to this dashboard is comparing the performance of different political parties during their tenure in government. Parties such as PPP, PMLN, Military, PMLQ, and PTI can be evaluated based on various parameters, providing insights into their impact on Pakistan's 
economy and standards
